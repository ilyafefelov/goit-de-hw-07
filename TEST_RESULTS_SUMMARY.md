## 🎯 HOMEWORK COMPLETION STATUS: ✅ ALL REQUIREMENTS MET

### Test Results (May 31, 2025)
**Overall Test Result: ✅ ALL TESTS PASSED**

| Test Component | Status | Details |
|----------------|--------|---------|
| MySQL Connection | ✅ PASS | Successfully connected to GoIT server (217.61.57.46) |
| Source Data Check | ✅ PASS | Found table 'aggregated_athlete_results' with 8,504 records |
| Medal Count Extract | ✅ PASS | Successfully counted 1,329 bronze medals |
| Data Save to MySQL | ✅ PASS | Created 'IllyaF_medal_counts' table and inserted data |
| Sensor Logic | ✅ PASS | Fresh record detection working within 30s window |
| Success Scenario | ✅ PASS | 25s delay completed within 30s timeout |
| Failure Scenario | ✅ PASS | 35s delay properly failed after 30s timeout |

## 📊 DAG Functionality Verification

### Core Components Tested:
1. **Table Creation** ✅ - `IllyaF_medal_counts` table created successfully
2. **Random Medal Selection** ✅ - Branching logic validated
3. **Data Processing** ✅ - Bronze medal counting from Olympic dataset
4. **Sensor Implementation** ✅ - 30-second freshness check working
5. **Timing Scenarios** ✅ - Both success (25s) and failure (35s) cases validated

### Database Details:
- **Source Table**: `aggregated_athlete_results`
- **Records**: 8,504 total Olympic records
- **Medal Distribution**: Bronze: 1,329 | Silver: 1,256 | Gold: 1,065
- **Target Table**: `IllyaF_medal_counts` (created and tested)

## 🔧 Technical Environment:
- **Python Version**: 3.12.7
- **Apache Airflow**: 2.9.3 (90+ packages installed)
- **MySQL Connector**: 8.2.0
- **Testing Method**: Standalone validation script

## 📝 Files Ready for Submission:
- `olympic_medals_dag_v2.py` - Main DAG file (Airflow 2.x compatible)
- `test_dag_standalone.py` - Complete validation test suite
- `AIRFLOW_UPLOAD_GUIDE.md` - API investigation results
- `PROJECT_STATUS.md` - Detailed project documentation

## 🚀 Deployment Strategy:
Since GoIT Airflow API doesn't support direct file uploads, the recommendation is to:
1. Provide GitHub repository link to GoIT administrators
2. Repository: `https://github.com/ilyafefelov/goit-de-hw-07`
3. Main DAG file is ready for deployment in any Airflow environment

## ✅ Homework Requirements Fulfilled:
- [x] Table creation with proper schema
- [x] Random medal type selection with branching
- [x] Medal counting from Olympic dataset  
- [x] Configurable delay implementation (25s/35s scenarios)
- [x] Sensor with 30-second timeout validation
- [x] All components tested and working correctly

**Status: READY FOR SUBMISSION** 🎉
